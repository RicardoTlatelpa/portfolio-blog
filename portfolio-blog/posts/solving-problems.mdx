# Programs

When starting out at the gym the biggest thing that was overwhelming to me was picking a program I had to stick with. When you’re a beginner in the gym surrounded by so many fit people, the last thing you want to do is look dumb and not know what you’re doing. After 2 years of strength training, I still find myself in that position, and that’s ok! The most important part of lifting is sticking with it, and discovering what your body could do and handle. Strength training did wonders to my body, lifting heavy weights week by week gave me a thrill, and it gave me a confidence I never thought I had. I’ve met really smart people that seemed to know what they were doing, but they charged money that I didn’t have. So I was stuck with figuring it out by myself. I learned from watching youtube, and from friends that have been doing it longer than I have, and I found that many people(just like me) picked up the pieces and made it work. Many people came in with different goals. Some wanted to grow a bigger back, bigger chest, bigger arms. Some people wanted to max out the bench press, the squat, their deadlift, etc. For me, I was lucky enough to hear about the starting strength program.

# Starting strength

The starting strength program is a beginner program that helps you grow stronger all around. I was able to improve my squat, my bench press, my over head press, my deadlift, and my barbell row. This program taught me so much about what strength is, and how to efficiently use my body to handle some heavy ass weight. I didn’t know anything about programming a gym routine, or why I had to do 5 reps for 5 sets, or why the barbell workouts that the program chose were chosen. I just stuck with the program and I grew stronger. In a years time I was benching over 225 pounds, squatting over 315 pounds, deadlifting over 405 pounds, and over head pressing over 135 pounds. It felt like magic. I later found out that the strength program I did helped me transition to other exercises easily.

I realized much later that I had squeezed out all my beginner gains after that first year. I started getting clues by constantly stalling/failing in all my lifts. I started to feel burnt out from working out, but the gym was everything to me so I kept working out despite the burn out. I did grow stronger and stuck with the starting strength program for another year, but I later found out that I had stuck with the program for too long, but that program was special to me because it had a great mobile application that helped me track/deload/progress on all my lifts.

# Tracking

I remembered when I first found out about the starting strength program. I was staring blankly at a google spreadsheet that had all the scheduling, workouts, and rule sets for the program. I remember most of the programs I looked at the time all had the same way of managing themselves. It was ugly, it seemed tedious, and it was such a pain to open up on your phone to put in your numbers to track week by week.

## Who tracked who?

I thought tracking with spreadsheets was a pain, until I noticed that other people tracked their workouts in their notebooks(yes physical notebooks). What if they ran out of ink in their pen? Yeah gyms got pens, but what if they lost that notebook or someone spilled water on their notebook, or it fell in their laundry bin and all that ink made the notebook impossible to read? I’ve seen other gym go-ers use the notes app on their iphone to track their progress week by week. I’ve seen many ways people track their gym progress, and again I was lucky enough to find an app that not only helped me track the starting strength 5 x 5 program, but it helped me deload when I stalled on my lifts and it helped me progress session by session too!

# Plateaus

I’ve sadly ran the starting strength program too many times, and given my max numbers have decided to move on to another program that can help me continue progressing my strength. I’ve reached the intermediate stage. There is no app for my recommended strength programs. Does this mean it’s back to spread sheets and workout tracking apps where I don’t enjoy the user experience?
