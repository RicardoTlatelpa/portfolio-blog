## Discovering Strength Through 5x5

Personally, I have done the 5x5 strength program in my personal life and ran cycles of this program for a little over two years. I branched out of my program while keeping the core compound lifts of the 5x5 program. I did this because I enjoyed compound lifting and the benefits it brought to me (overall strength).

Eventually, hypertrophy and aesthetics intrigued me, and I wanted to keep learning and growing more aesthetically and as a gym lifter.

I saw someone who was much older than me. This person was incredibly strong at powerlifting, but I didn’t really like his physique. I noticed that aesthetically my legs were incredible, but the rest of my body seemed to lack the wow factor I got from showing off my quads.

So, I started to branch off into other things.

## Branching out in the Gym

Once you’ve been doing something for so long, you begin to think you’re an expert at it. I’ve grown comfortable deadlifting, bench pressing, overhead pressing, and rowing. I’ve grown so comfortable that I felt I could teach it.

I’ve taught compound lifts to several people and noticed the little nuances that I’ve worked on from repeatedly getting better at doing the compound movements. I was efficient with my body; I had little quirks that kept me aligned and powerful.

I was training for power, but I didn’t know that when I first started my lifting journey. I was explosive and overall strong, but still not aesthetic — which, to many people, signals that they work out and that they are disciplined. I never chased that, but I did know it was important to have.

Eventually along my gym journey, I wanted to work on things that I never thought I could do because I was once fat and unathletic — like pull-ups, push-ups, building abs, playing sports. Again, branching off from where I started.

## The Beginner's Mindset

I was again in an awkward place. I knew what it took to get good at something — practicing it over and over again — and the little kid inside of me kept telling me that if I got good at thing A, it would transfer over to thing B.

But that’s just not how things work.

Just because you can run and have high amounts of stamina and endurance doesn’t mean that transfers over to a combat sport. Yeah, your starting point would be better than an obese person’s starting point, but you’d both have the same skill level in the beginning. The only difference is that the more fit person’s learning curve would be easier to traverse.

When you begin something new, you don’t know what the hell you’re doing. I’ve been there — plenty of times. Sure, you can use your intuition and build on what you already know because working out isn’t rocket science. But it’s still scary to start.

There are so many workouts that target different parts of your body. There are so many goals you can chase. There are so many different types of routines — or as I like to call them, programs.

Just like shopping for a cologne or a candle — I want something that I find to be the best. And with something as time-consuming and difficult as working out, I want to make the best of my time while working out the best I can every session.

## Plateaus and Progress

When a beginner first starts to train, they don’t really know if what they’re doing is working because they’re progressing at lightning speed (beginner gains). This is an effect that every gym-goer experiences when they consistently show up and progress with their workout activities.

Eventually, a gym-goer plateaus, and this usually happens when the working weight you’re doing doesn’t push or pull like the previous workout session weights did.

What do you do then?

- Do you deload?
- Do you try your best to continue the workout with a weight you can’t work with effectively?
- How do you get past this bump in the road?

These are the questions I’m trying to unmask for people — and for myself — because at the end of the day, we are always going to be beginners. And I think that’s okay.

Accepting that you’re a beginner at something you’ve invested a lot of time in is hard to do, but it can be easier to accept with a tool like AI.

## Why AI in the Gym?

With the use of AI, we can begin to answer these questions while also tracking our progress.

The purpose of my gym application is to help lifters, or gym-goers from all types of disciplines, to not only understand what they’re training but to enhance their training and assist them when they want to improve in different aspects of their gym experience.
