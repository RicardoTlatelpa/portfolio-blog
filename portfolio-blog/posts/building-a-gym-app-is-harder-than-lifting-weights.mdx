title: "[Building a Gym App Is Harder Than Lifting Weights]"

When I first started building my gym app, I thought it would be simple:
track sets, reps, and weight.

That's how I've always tracked my own training. But the deeper I got into the project, the more I realized that strength training isn't one-size-fits-all, and neither is the data model behind it.

Designing an app that can handle beginner friendly linear progression, intermediate block training, and advanced deloading strategies has been a challenge.

## From Linear Progression to Complex Training styles

Most beginners train using linear progression. It's straight forward: if you squat 135 lbs for 5x5 today, next time you try 140lbs. Simple.

But as lifters get stronger, training complexity increases. I learned about different progression strategies.

- Linear weekly: instead of adding weight every session, the increase happens every week.
- Block progression: weights are cycled over multiple weeks(4 week strength blocks)
- Double progression: instead of always adding weight, you progress weight within a range(6-10 reps). Once you hit the top of the range, you add weight and reset the reps.

For my schema, that meant capturing progression type + increment rules per exercise, not just tracking "sets and reps".

## Deloading

Progression isn't forever. At some point in your training, you fail. You either fail, or reach a period where you feel burnt out by the weights you've progressed to. This is where de-loading comes into the picture.

### Defining de-loading for an exercise

- Time-based deload: automatically reduce weight after a set period
- Failure based deload: reduce weight after missing a lift for multiple sessions
- Block-based deload: programmed into the end of a block cycle

Something I had to keep in mind in the program creation phase of the application was making sure that deloading rules are paired with the appropriate progressive overloading rules.

My vision for this application is to allow for as much flexibility as possible, but to not allow users to take a training path that may not make sense.

## Keeping the user experience in mind

It's a challenge viewing the high level scope of training programming and trying to display this information as condensed and as friendly as possible on a mobile application.

On the backend, I model progression rules and deload rules per exercise/program.

On the front-end, the user only sees what they need:

- Pick an exercise
- Define progression once(per program)
- Define deload once(per program)
- Add the exercise to multiple sessions, and the app automatically applies the rules when a user starts tracking their workout sessions in a program

This allows for a seamless tracking experience. If a user adds Bench press to Monday and Friday sessions, they don't have to redefine progression rules twice for that program. They just lift, log, and let the app handle the structure.

For the user, the benefit is simple:

- they get a clear roadmap for progression
- they don't have to manually calculate when to add weight or when to deload
- the app adapts to their training styles and level

All they really need to in the gym is focus on form and consistency.

Behind the scenes, the app's schema is doing all the heavy lifting, tracking their lifts and sessions, and determining their weekly schedule based on the program they are subscribed to.
