# Understanding Progression and Deload Types in Strength Training

When you train without a plan it is easy to fall into random workouts  
But when you follow structured programming you will often see two key elements at play

**Progression** is how the difficulty of an exercise increases over time  
**Deloading** is how and when the intensity is reduced to allow recovery

In building my gym application I had to model each progression type and its recommended deload pairing in the database so the system can guide a user through training like a real coach would

## Progression Types

### 1. LINEAR

**What it is**  
You add a fixed amount of weight every time you successfully complete all the planned sets and reps

**Example**  
If you bench press 135 lbs for 3×8 today next time you do 140 lbs for 3×8

**Recommended deload pairing**

- Fixed amount drop after repeated failures
- Trigger after two or three failed sessions in a row

### 2. LINEAR WEEKLY

**What it is**  
Instead of adding weight every session you increase the load once per week

**Example**  
If you squat 200 lbs for 5×5 this week next week you try 205 lbs for 5×5

**Recommended deload pairing**

- Percentage drop after six to eight weeks
- Trigger on a time schedule such as every eight weeks

### 3. BLOCK

**What it is**  
You train in blocks of multiple weeks often three to six weeks then reset or adjust load after the block ends This is common in periodized programs

**Example**  
Weeks one to four gradually increase from eighty percent to ninety percent of your one rep max  
Week five drop to seventy five percent and start a new block

**Recommended deload pairing**

- Percentage drop after each block
- Trigger at block completion

### 4. DOUBLE

**What it is**  
You increase weight only when you hit the top end of a rep range then reset reps lower and build up again

**Example**  
Bench 185 lbs for 3×8 Over time reach 3×10 Then increase to 190 lbs and drop back to 3×6 building up again

**Recommended deload pairing**

- Fixed drop after repeated failures
- Trigger after two or three failed attempts at the top end of the rep range

## Why This Matters in the App

Each progression type requires specific tracking data and has its own deload logic

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Progression Type</th>
      <th>Recommended Deload Type</th>
      <th>Trigger</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>LINEAR</td>
      <td>Fixed</td>
      <td>Failure based</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>LINEAR WEEKLY</td>
      <td>Percentage</td>
      <td>Time based</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>BLOCK</td>
      <td>Percentage</td>
      <td>Block completion</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>DOUBLE</td>
      <td>Fixed</td>
      <td>Failure based</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

By pairing these choices in the data model the app can

- Suggest when to deload automatically
- Apply the correct amount of weight reduction
- Continue progression smoothly after a deload

This means the app is not just a workout logger it is a coaching tool  
It helps structure training so that users make steady gains while managing fatigue and recovery

When a user selects an exercise and progression type the app knows what to track when to push harder and when to pull back  
That is how random gym sessions become a purposeful training journey
