Best case scenario when I am performing a strength training session is hitting all my reps for all my sets. This scenario sets me up for a heavier session the next type I perform that exercise. For my strength progression the sets and reps remain the same, but the weight goes up by around 5 pounds. I’ve failed strength training sessions many times, usually what I do in those situations is squeeze out as many reps as I can within the defined sets of that training session. If the reps are 5, then I’m going to try to get as close as I can to 5 reps for each set. Usually these sessions are “failed” sessions(I didn’t get the complete amount of reps that was intended for me that session). Worst case, this failed session happens to me continuously 3 times. In those cases, I de-load the amount of weight I’m doing by 10%. So If I fail a 200 pound bench press 3 sessions in a row, I de-load back to 180 for my working set on the bench press.

I have been continuously progressing and de-loading this way with my bench press, squat, deadlift, over head press, and barbell row for the past 2 years.

I’ve enjoyed the process of de-loading and progressing the weight. I’ve grown comfortable revisiting numbers that I previously struggled with, but have now turned into my de-load working weight. This has gave me the confidence to continue training because weights that seemed a lot to me soon turned into de-load weight and then eventually into warm ups.

But I won’t deny the fact that there had been weeks where the progression of the weight with the same reps and sets have burnt me out. Besides being burnt out, I felt that sometimes the reps and sets were too high of a volume on some weeks.
