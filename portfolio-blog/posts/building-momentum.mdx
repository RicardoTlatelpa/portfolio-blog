# Building Momentum: Weekly Progress on the Gym App

This past week was all about connecting the dots between the **UI** and our **Zustand program builder store**. Each step we take gets us closer to a smooth experience for users creating and managing their workouts.

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Workout Session Exercise Display

We implemented a way to **display exercises inside a session** as they are being created. This includes:

- The **activity template** (what the exercise is based on)
- Its **progression rules**
- Its **deload rules**

This makes sessions much more transparentâ€”users can now see exactly how their workouts are structured, not just which exercises were added.

### 2. New Selector in `useProgramBuilder`

We introduced a new function, `makeSelectSessionExerciseViews`, that pulls together everything needed for rendering exercises in a workout session. This selector:

- Grabs the exercise data
- Connects it with the right activity template
- Merges progression and deload rules into a single view

This significantly reduces complexity when working with exercises in the UI.

### 3. Updated Workout Session Exercise Card

The **WorkoutSessionExerciseCard** component was updated to use this new structure. Instead of juggling multiple props and states, it now cleanly receives the exercise view object and renders:

- Exercise name
- Activity details
- Progression & deload logic

This makes the UI more **consistent and reliable**.

### 4. Cleaner `WorkoutSessions` Screen

The **WorkoutSessions** screen was updated to display the new exercise cards properly. Now, when users add exercises, they immediately see them represented in full detail.

### 5. Store Improvements

In the program builder store, we cleaned up legacy code and aligned everything with the new exercise variation model. This ensures:

- Every exercise in a session is treated as a **variation**
- No leftover logic from outdated approaches clutters the store

This makes the codebase easier to maintain and extend.

## Why This Matters

These updates might seem technical, but they directly impact the **user experience**:

- Clearer visualization of workout sessions
- Less confusion about progression and deloading
- A smoother flow between backend logic and frontend presentation

It also sets the foundation for **future features** like editing exercises directly in a session, previewing session difficulty, and syncing with the program exercise library.

## Whatâ€™s Next

Looking ahead, we plan to:

- Expand the **Program Exercise Library** with more detailed variation views
- Implement better search and filtering for exercises
- Start refining the **multi-step program creation flow**

Each of these steps pushes us closer to the polished, user-friendly gym application weâ€™ve envisioned. ðŸš€
