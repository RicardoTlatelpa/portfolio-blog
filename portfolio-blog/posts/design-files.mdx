I took the engineering approach to designing a system that is reusable, easy to extend and maintain.
Looking at the smaller details first and building the atoms of the project took some time. I had to choose colors
that I felt matched the personality of the project. I wanted to build something that resembled a sciency, safe, but
luxirious experience when tracking and maintaing programs.

## User experience

When a user uses the app I want them to feel that the app is safe and reliable. I want the colors to feel friendly and inviting to work on.
