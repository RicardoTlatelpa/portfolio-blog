<br />I approached the design system like an engineer(building from the ground up),
focusing on reliability, scalability, and ease of maintenance. Rather jumping into
full screens, I spent time crafting the atoms, then the molecules, then the organisms,
the templates, and finally the screens.

The color section was something I wanted to reflect on the personality of the application. Something scientific, safe, and luxurious. Each color serves a purpose, from semantic error/success states to soft neutrals that reduce visual fatigue. Font choices and spacing were guided by real usage context: small screens, fast decisions, sweaty fingers.

## User experience

When someone uses the app, I want them to feel like they’re interacting with a well-engineered companion, not a chaotic dashboard. I want users to feel like the app respects their time by making every tap feel intentional, fast, and rewarding.

## The benefits

The components, started to become templates, and templates started to become screens, and it was amazing to see how consistent the prototypal experiences started to become.

This process also helped bridge the gap between design and engineering. I wasn’t just designing something that looked good, I was designing with implementation in mind, using utility first styling with NativeWind and keeping everything aligned with Figma.

I was able to extend the tailwind library with all my custom fonts, colors, and spacings:

```javascript
// theme.js
const colors = {
  primary: {
    50: '#E1EDFF',
    100: '#C4DBFF',
    200: '#A6C9FF',
    300: '#89B6FF',
    400: '#6BA4FF',
    500: '#3A86FF',
    600: '#005BEB',
    700: '#0048BC',
    800: '#00368D',
    900: '#00245E',
  },
```
